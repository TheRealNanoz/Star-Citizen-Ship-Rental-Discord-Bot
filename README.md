# Star-Citizen-Ship-Rental-Discord-Bot
## how to install / use
- the code is working as expected, the only modification the user has to make to the code is to add their discord bot token into the bot_token variable which has a comment instructing you to do so.
## The commands are:
- !RENT_COST <"ship name">
  - this will take the ship name and find the rental price and location through the UEXCORP.space api, along with an image
- !RENT_LIST
  - this will list all available ships for rent and their prices through the UEXCORP.space api
